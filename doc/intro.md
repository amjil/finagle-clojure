## [Finagle](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/)

Finagle is a framework open sourced by Twitter for writing highly concurrent RPC services.
It is written in Scala and also provides bindings in Java.

This library assumes you have a working knowledge of Finagle concepts.
A thin wrapper around Future operations is provided.
